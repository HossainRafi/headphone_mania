They are very comfortable and provide superb listening experience at home, traveling or in a noisy office. They incorporate extremely effective noise suppression, have easy-to-operate controls and a very long battery life. Their unmatched quality is evident in every feature."

Let’s start with inside the box where we have a hard carrying case, the headphones, a usb type C cable, an airplane adapter, a 3.5mm cable along with the usual paperwork."

It may seem weird, but sometimes I forget that I am wearing them. They are adjustable and the ear cups are soft and don't press on my ears. I have worn them until the power drains with no issues. I also love the matte black color."

And you’re obviously curious about what the differences are between the WH-1000MX3 against the newly launched WH-1000MX4. Well to cut a long story short, the changes are more subtle and not a radical improvement. So does this mean the WH-1000MX4 is not a good buy? Let’s find out with my first impressions of the Sony WH-1000MX4."

The headband portion also has plenty of padding so that the headphones rest comfortably on the top of your head. This is highly recomended for anyon e who loves music."

    "comment": "Best for TV viewing and Sony dual Bluetooth function helps you hear the cell ring. If you take the headphone off it pauses the movie.The noise cancelling is not as good as Bose but a slight increase of volume compensates. Battery life is phenomenal, yes 3-4 movies easy before charge necessary. Recharges swiftly too."
